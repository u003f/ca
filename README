Matlab code to run the cellular automaton described in:

Smallbone K, Gatenby RA, Gillies RJ, Maini PK, Gavaghan DJ (2007) 
"Metabolic changes during carcinogenesis: potential impact on invasiveness" 
J Theor Biol. 244:703-713
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.09.010

You can run a simulation (at default parameters) through
> [C,g,c,h,p,m1,m2,m3] = kCA;

The state of the automaton at generation 100 can then be visualised by
> kCAFigPlotter(C,m1,m2,m3,100);

Innumerable thanks to Ornella Cominetti for saving this code, which
would otherwise have been lost in the ether.
